## Philosophy

- Based on [suckless](https://suckless.org/philosophy/) and
[unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) philosophies
- Software should do not more and not less than what the user needs
    * Every feature is implemented in the most simple and straightforward form: keep it simple, fast, and clear
- Software is made for users capable of reading and customizing its source code
    * Source code can be read by users in one evening
    * External configuration is not necessary and discouraged
    * User manual documentation is not necessary, _hacking_ documentation is encouraged (via [`HACKING.md`](HACKING.md))
- Software is distributed as source code, compiled by the user
- Software is not meant to be developed forever and its final state should be described by its feature set from
the beginning
- Software is extended either by the user directly or by applying
[source code patches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)#Source_code_patching), distributed as diff files
    * It is encouraged to share your extensions with others who can find it useful
